What is linguistics?"></a>1. What is linguistics?</h1><h2 id="1-1-Definition"><a href="#1-1-Definition" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Definition"></a>1.1 Definition</h2><p>Linguistics is generally defined as the <strong>scientific study of language</strong>. The word “language” preceded by the zero article in English implies that linguistics studies not any particular language, e.g., English, Chinese, Arabic, and Latin, but languages in general. The word “study” does not mean “lean” but “investigate” or “examine.” And the word “scientific” refers to the way in which it is studied. A scientific sutdy of language is based on the systematic investigation of data, conducted with reference to some general theory of language structure. In order to discover the nature of the underlying language system, what the linguist has to do first is to sudy language facts, i.e., to see how language is actually used; then he formulates some hypotheses about the language structure. But the hypotheses thus formed have to be checked repeatedly against the observed facts. In linguistics, as in any other discipline, data and theory stand in a dialectical complementation; that is, a theory without the support of data can hardly claim validity, and data without being explained by some theory remain a muddled mass of things.</p>
<p>Thus the process of linguistic study can be summarized as follows; First, certain linguistic facts are oberved, which are found to display some similarities, and generalizations are made about them; next based on these generalizations, hypothese are formulated to account for these facts; and then the hypotheses are tested by further observations; and finally a linguistic theory is constructed about what language is and how it works.</p>
<h2 id="1-2-The-scope-of-linguistics"><a href="#1-2-The-scope-of-linguistics" class="headerlink" title="1.2 The scope of linguistics"></a>1.2 The scope of linguistics</h2><p>The study of language as a whole is often called general linguistics. This deals with the basic concepts, theories, descriptions, models and methods applicable in any linguistic study, in contrast to those branches of study which relate linguistics to the research of other areas.</p>
<p>Language is a complicated entity with multiple layers and facets, so it is hardly possible for the linguists to deal with it all at once. They have to concentrate on one aspect of it at a time.</p>
<p>What first drew the attention of the linguists were the sounds used in languages. This study of sounds used in linguistic communication led to the establishment of a branch of linguistics called <strong>phonetics</strong>.</p>
<p>Then, as linguists became interested in how sounds are put together and used to convey meaning in communication, they developed another branch of study related to sounds called <strong>phonology</strong>.</p>
<p>While sounds are primary in linguistic communication, they are represented by certain symbols, i.e., words and even smaller components called morphemes. The study of the way in which these symbols are arranged to form words has constituted the branch of study called <strong>morphology</strong>.</p>
<p>Then the combination of these words to form permissible sentences in languages is governed by rules. The study of these rules constitutes a major branch of linguistic studies, i.e., <strong>syntax</strong>.</p>
<p>But the ultimate objective of language is not just to create grammatically well-formed sentences, but to convey meaning. So the study of meaning was gradually developed and became known as <strong>semantics</strong>.</p>
<p>Language communication does not occur in a vacuum. It always occurs in a context, i.e., it always occurs at a certain time, at a certain place, between participants with particular intentions. When the study of meaning is conducted, not in isolation, but in the context of use, it becomes another branch of linguistic study called <strong>pragmatics</strong>.</p>
<p>The study of all these aspects of language forms the core of linguistics.</p>
<p>Then, language is not an isolated phenomenon; it is a social activity carried out in a certain social environment by human beings. Naturally, in the course of time the study of language has established close links with other branchs of social studies, resulting in interdisciplinary branches of linguistic study.</p>
<p>Language and society are closely connected. The language a person uses often reveals his social background, and there exist social norms that determine the type of language to be used on a certain occasion; and language changes are often caused by social changes. The study of all these social aspects of language and its relation with society form the core of the branch called <strong>sociolinguistics</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Psycholinguistics</strong> relates the study of language to psychology. It aims to answer such questions as how the human mind works when we use language, how we as infants acquire our mother tongue, how we memorize, and how we process the information we receive in the course of communication.</p>
<p>Findings in linguistic stuies can often be applied to the soulution of such practical problems as the recovery of speech ability. The sutdy of such applications is generally known as applied linguistics. But in a narrow sense applied linguistics refers to the application of linguistic theories and principles to language teaching, especially the teaching of foreign and second languages. Language teachers should first of all learn the language rules before they can teach these rules to the students; teaching material development, teaching syllabus design, evaluation of teaching arid learning are all guided by linguistic priciples and theories. The emergence of a new teaching approach or method often follows the emergence of a new linguistic theory.</p>
<p>Other related branches include authropological linguistics, neurological inguistics, mathermatical linguistics, and computational linguistics.</p></div><p class="readmore"><a href="/2023/07/21/CHAPTER-1-INTRODUCTION/">Read More</a></p></div><div class="post"><h1 class="post-title"><a href="/2023/07/21/I-d-Rather-Be-Black-than-Female/">I'd Rather Be Black than Female</a></h1><div class="post-meta">2023-07-21</div><div class="post-content"><p>Being the first black woman elected to Congress has made me some kind of phenomenon.<br>我是第一位当选国会议员的黑人妇女，这使我不同凡响。</p>
