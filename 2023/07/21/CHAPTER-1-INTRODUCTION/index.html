What is linguistics?"></a>1. What is linguistics?</h1><h2 id="1-1-Definition"><a href="#1-1-Definition" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Definition"></a>1.1 Definition</h2><p>Linguistics is generally defined as the <strong>scientific study of language</strong>. The word “language” preceded by the zero article in English implies that linguistics studies not any particular language, e.g., English, Chinese, Arabic, and Latin, but languages in general. The word “study” does not mean “lean” but “investigate” or “examine.” And the word “scientific” refers to the way in which it is studied. A scientific sutdy of language is based on the systematic investigation of data, conducted with reference to some general theory of language structure. In order to discover the nature of the underlying language system, what the linguist has to do first is to sudy language facts, i.e., to see how language is actually used; then he formulates some hypotheses about the language structure. But the hypotheses thus formed have to be checked repeatedly against the observed facts. In linguistics, as in any other discipline, data and theory stand in a dialectical complementation; that is, a theory without the support of data can hardly claim validity, and data without being explained by some theory remain a muddled mass of things.</p>
<p>Thus the process of linguistic study can be summarized as follows; First, certain linguistic facts are oberved, which are found to display some similarities, and generalizations are made about them; next based on these generalizations, hypothese are formulated to account for these facts; and then the hypotheses are tested by further observations; and finally a linguistic theory is constructed about what language is and how it works.</p>
<h2 id="1-2-The-scope-of-linguistics"><a href="#1-2-The-scope-of-linguistics" class="headerlink" title="1.2 The scope of linguistics"></a>1.2 The scope of linguistics</h2><p>The study of language as a whole is often called general linguistics. This deals with the basic concepts, theories, descriptions, models and methods applicable in any linguistic study, in contrast to those branches of study which relate linguistics to the research of other areas.</p>
<p>Language is a complicated entity with multiple layers and facets, so it is hardly possible for the linguists to deal with it all at once. They have to concentrate on one aspect of it at a time.</p>
<p>What first drew the attention of the linguists were the sounds used in languages. This study of sounds used in linguistic communication led to the establishment of a branch of linguistics called <strong>phonetics</strong>.</p>
<p>Then, as linguists became interested in how sounds are put together and used to convey meaning in communication, they developed another branch of study related to sounds called <strong>phonology</strong>.</p>
<p>While sounds are primary in linguistic communication, they are represented by certain symbols, i.e., words and even smaller components called morphemes. The study of the way in which these symbols are arranged to form words has constituted the branch of study called <strong>morphology</strong>.</p>
<p>Then the combination of these words to form permissible sentences in languages is governed by rules. The study of these rules constitutes a major branch of linguistic studies, i.e., <strong>syntax</strong>.</p>
<p>But the ultimate objective of language is not just to create grammatically well-formed sentences, but to convey meaning. So the study of meaning was gradually developed and became known as <strong>semantics</strong>.</p>
<p>Language communication does not occur in a vacuum. It always occurs in a context, i.e., it always occurs at a certain time, at a certain place, between participants with particular intentions. When the study of meaning is conducted, not in isolation, but in the context of use, it becomes another branch of linguistic study called <strong>pragmatics</strong>.</p>
<p>The study of all these aspects of language forms the core of linguistics.</p>
<p>Then, language is not an isolated phenomenon; it is a social activity carried out in a certain social environment by human beings. Naturally, in the course of time the study of language has established close links with other branchs of social studies, resulting in interdisciplinary branches of linguistic study.</p>
<p>Language and society are closely connected. The language a person uses often reveals his social background, and there exist social norms that determine the type of language to be used on a certain occasion; and language changes are often caused by social changes. The study of all these social aspects of language and its relation with society form the core of the branch called <strong>sociolinguistics</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Psycholinguistics</strong> relates the study of language to psychology. It aims to answer such questions as how the human mind works when we use language, how we as infants acquire our mother tongue, how we memorize, and how we process the information we receive in the course of communication.</p>
<p>Findings in linguistic stuies can often be applied to the soulution of such practical problems as the recovery of speech ability. The sutdy of such applications is generally known as applied linguistics. But in a narrow sense applied linguistics refers to the application of linguistic theories and principles to language teaching, especially the teaching of foreign and second languages. Language teachers should first of all learn the language rules before they can teach these rules to the students; teaching material development, teaching syllabus design, evaluation of teaching arid learning are all guided by linguistic priciples and theories. The emergence of a new teaching approach or method often follows the emergence of a new linguistic theory.</p>
<p>Other related branches include authropological linguistics, neurological inguistics, mathermatical linguistics, and computational linguistics.</p>

<h2 id="1-3-Some-important-distinctions-in-linguistics"><a href="#1-3-Some-important-distinctions-in-linguistics" class="headerlink" title="1.3 Some important distinctions in linguistics"></a>1.3 Some important distinctions in linguistics</h2><h3 id="1-3-1-Prescriptive-vs-descriptive"><a href="#1-3-1-Prescriptive-vs-descriptive" class="headerlink" title="1.3.1 Prescriptive vs. descriptive"></a>1.3.1 Prescriptive vs. descriptive</h3><p>If a linguistic study describes and analyzes the language people actually use, it is said to be <strong>descriptive</strong>; if it aims to lay down rules for “correct” behaviour, i.e., to tell people what they should say and what they should not say, it is said to be **prescriptive”</p>
<p>Modern linguistics, i.e., linguistic study carried out in this century is mostly descriptive. It differs from the linguistic study normally known as “grammar.” Early grammars were based on “high”(religous,literary)written languase. They set models for language users to follow. And today, the grammar taught to learners of a language is still basically prescriptive. It tells the learner what he should say, or what is supposed to be correct usage. On the other hand, modern linguistics is mostly descriptive. Linguistic study is supposed to be scientific and objective and the task of linguists is supposed to describe the language people actually use, be it “correct” or not. Linguists believe that whatever occurs in the language people use should be described and analyzed in their investigation.</p>
<h3 id="1-3-2-Synchronic-vs-diachronic"><a href="#1-3-2-Synchronic-vs-diachronic" class="headerlink" title="1.3.2 Synchronic vs. diachronic"></a>1.3.2 Synchronic vs. diachronic</h3><p>Language exists in time and changes through time. The description of a language at some point in time is a <strong>synchronic</strong> study; the description of a language as it changes through time is a <strong>diachronic</strong> study. A diachronic study of language is a historical study; it studies the historical development of language over a period of time. For example, a study of the features of the English used in Shakespeare’s time would be a synchronic study, and a study of the changes English has undergone since then would be a diachronic study.</p>
<p>In modern linguistics synchronic study seems to enjoy priority over diachronic study. The reason is that unless the various states of a language are successfully studied it would be difficult to describe the changes that have taken place in its historical development. Synchronic descriptions are often thought of as being descriptions of a language as it exists at the present day and most linguistic studies are of this type.</p>
<h3 id="1-3-3-Speech-and-writing"><a href="#1-3-3-Speech-and-writing" class="headerlink" title="1.3.3 Speech and writing"></a>1.3.3 Speech and writing</h3><p>Speech and writing are the two major media of communication. Modern linguistics regards the spoken language as primary, not the written.</p>
<p>In the past, traditional grammarians tened to over-emphasize the importance of the written word, partly because of its permanence. Before the invention of sound recording, it was difficult for people to deal with utterances which existed only for seconds. Then, the traditional classical education was also partly to blame. People were encouraged to imitate the “best authors” for language usage.</p>
<p>But modern linguistics gives priority to the spoken form of language, which is considered as more basic than the written form for a number of reasons. First, in any human society we know of, speech prcedes writing. The writing system of any language is always a later invention, used to record the speech. While quite a number of languaes in the world today have both spoken and written forms, there are still mnay languages that have only the spoken form. And then in terms of function, the spoken languages is used for a wider range of purposes than the written, and carries a larger load of communication than the written.</p>
<h3 id="1-3-4-Langue-and-parole"><a href="#1-3-4-Langue-and-parole" class="headerlink" title="1.3.4 Langue and parole"></a>1.3.4 Langue and parole</h3><p>The distinction between langue and parole was made by the Swiss linguist F. de Saussure early this century. Langue and parole are French words. Langue refers to the abstract linguistic system shared by all the members of a speech community, and parole refers to the realization of langue in actual use. Langue is the set of conventions and rules which language users all have to abide by, and parole is the concrete use of the conventions and the application of the rules. Langue is abstract; it is not the language people actually use. Parole is concrete; it refers to the naturally occurring language events. Langue is relatively stable, it does not change frequently; while parole varies from person to person, and from situation to situation. Take for example the structure of a sentence in English. An English sentence must have a subject and a predicate. This is a rule agreed on by all the English speakers. This is part of the langue. while adhering to the same abstract system, each user of English has his own way of applying the rules. Thus each act of speaking is a unique event, different from any other act.</p>
<p>Saussure made this distinction in order to single out one aspect of language for serious study. In his opinion, parole is simply a mass of linguistic facts, too varied and confusing for systematic invesigation, and what linguists should do is to abstract langue from parole, i.e., to discover the regularities governing the actual use of language and make them the subjects of study of linguistics.</p>
<h3 id="1-3-5-Competence-and-performance"><a href="#1-3-5-Competence-and-performance" class="headerlink" title="1.3.5 Competence and performance"></a>1.3.5 Competence and performance</h3><p>Similar to Saussure’s distinction between langue and parole is the distinction between competence and performance, which was proposed by the American linguist N.Chomsky in the late 1950’s. Chomsky defines <strong>competence</strong> as the ideal user’s knownledge of the rules of his language, and <strong>performance</strong> the actual realization of this knowledge in linguistic communication. According to Chomsky, a speaker has internalized a set of rules about his language, this enables him to produce and understand and infinitely large number of sentences and recognize sentences that are ungrammatical and ambiguous. Despite his perfect knowledge of his own language, a spekaer ear still make mistakes in actual use, e.g., slips of the tongue, and unnecessary pauses. This imperfect performance is caused by social and psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and embarrassment. Similar to Saussure, Chomsky thinks that what linguists should study is the ideal speaker’s competence, not his performance, which is too haphazard to be studied. Although a speaker possesses an internalized set of rules and applies them in actual use, be can not tell exactly what these rules are. So the task of the linguists is to discover and specify these rules.</p>
<p>While Saussure’s distinction and Chomsky’s are very similar, they differ at least in that Saussure took a sociological view of language and his notion of langue is a matter of social conventions, and Chomsky looks at language from a psychological point of view and to him competence is a property of the mind of each individual.</p>
